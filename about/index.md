## Welcome to my home on the web!

### Who am I?

I'm Xila, a computer science student who codes mainly in Python. These are my main interests, and what I will probably write about:
-   Linux (uhh... I use Arch BTW)
-   Vim workflow
-   Open-source
-   Programming, I am most familiar with Python
-   Self-hosting and system administration
-   Online privacy and security

### About this website

Iâ€™ve always wanted to have my own website, so here it is. This blog is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static blog generator, and is currently being hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I have created this space to share some thoughts and ideas from my daily life or anything interesting I have learned. 

If you have any questions or comments about any of my posts feel free to send me an [email](mailto:fuzzygrim@protonmail,com). If you want to contact me somewhere else, I am also on Matrix as [@fuzzygrim:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@fuzzygrim:matrix.org). And well, there's always the option of creating an [issue](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/blog/issues) on Github.

I hope that you will find something useful among the selection of software or the incidental article on this site. Enjoy your stay!
