## Who am I?

I'm Xila, a computer science student who codes mainly in Python. These are my main interests, and what I will probably write about:
-   Linux
-   Vim workflow
-   Open-source
-   Programming
-   Self-hosting and system administration
-   Online privacy and security
-   Mechanical keyboards

## About this website

I’ve always wanted to have my own website, so here it is. This blog is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static blog generator, and is currently being hosted with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). I have created this space to share some thoughts and ideas from my daily life or anything interesting I have learned. 

If you have any questions or comments about any of my posts feel free to send me an [email](mailto:contact@fuzzygrim.com). If you want to contact me somewhere else, I am also on Matrix as [@fuzzygrim:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@fuzzygrim:matrix.org). And well, there's always the option of creating an [issue](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/blog/issues) on Github.

I hope that you will find something useful among the selection of software or the incidental article on this site. Enjoy your stay!
