## Games I have played

In chronological order:

-   Cuphead
-   Dead Space Remake
-   Resident Evil 4 Remake

So starting with Cuphead, I played it before solo but never finished it, this time I played it with a friend and we completed all the bosses. It was a fun experience, the game is challenging but fair, it's always satisfying to defeat a boss after many attempts. After playing most modern Resident Evil games, I wanted more survival horror games, so I played Dead Space Remake, it was a good experience but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, the game is good but it didn't click with me. Lastly, I played Resident Evil 4 Remake, I really wanted to play this game because I really liked the other Resident Evil games, and this was supposed to be one of the best, and boy was it, it was excellent, I enjoyed every moment and I even played the DLC, which was also great.
