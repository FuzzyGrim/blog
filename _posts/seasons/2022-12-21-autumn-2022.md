## SummonerStats

After working on [SummonerStats](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/SummonerStats) since as far back as 2020, I can finally say that it is in a state where I am happy with it. I learned so many technologies with this application, as it was my first "big" project, it was my first time using Django, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SQLite, and many more. Looking back, I'm not sure if it was a good idea to use so many new things at once, as I felt overwhelmed on several occasions and abandoned the project for many months. But I'm glad I stuck with it over the years and I'm happy and proud with the result.

## Yamtarr

Although I've been working on some small projects while I dropped SummonerStats, like [pokimg](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/pokimg), I haven't been working on anything big. I already knew what I wanted to work on next, so after finishing SummonerStats, I started working on [Yamtarr](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/Yamtarr), a self-hosted web application that helps you track all your media, such as movies, TV series, manga... 

It's still in early development, but I think it's looking good. I'm using Django again, which I enjoy working with and I think it's a useful framework to learn. I've also moved to SCSS after seeing how much easier and more enjoyable it is to work with compared to traditional CSS. The base of the application is done, the account system and media management is already there and I'm currently learning about unit testing and implementing it.
