## Games I have played

Continuing with my gaming journey, I've played two notable games this season, in chronological order:

-   Tape to Tape
-   Arena Breakout Infinite

Tape to Tape was a refreshing take on hockey with roguelite elements that I enjoyed with a friend - its blend of modern gameplay with 90s-inspired action and quirky features like AOE farts made for a fun, albeit short, experience. Arena Breakout Infinite has been my go-to game after leaving Escape from Tarkov due to its persistent issues with hackers and poor developer support, and I'm finding it to be a much more enjoyable alternative.
