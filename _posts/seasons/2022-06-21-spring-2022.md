I've seen on many other blogs people writing their monthly overviews of what happened, and I have been encouraged to try it out to reflect on what I have done and learned. However, since I don't like to write short posts, I have decided to write seasonal posts instead of monthly ones.

## Personal Projects

I've been working on [SummonerStats](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/SummonerStats), an open source project I've been working on for a while now. It's a web application that allows you to track your League of Legends summoner stats. I have dropped it countless times when I felt unmotivated, mainly because I struggled with CSS units and positioning, however, this time I learned about Flexbox which made everything easier and followed [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/kzkthl/comment/gjpns8i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about which units to use in each case which made the project more consistent.

The next problem to solve is to find good colors schemes for the website, I have been looking into [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) for now.

## VPS

I have rented for the first time a VPS, I chose RackNerd as I found a good deal on [LowEndBox](https://lowendbox.com/blog/racknerd-get-a-1-5-gb-ram-kvm-vps-for-15-78-year-and-more-available-in-multiple-locations), I have been using it for a while to host [Umami](https://github.com/mikecao/umami) as it needs to be on 24/7 and I don't have any complains about the service.

## Changes on this site

I [have been doing](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/blog/commits/master) some small changes to this blog. I've added a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/fuzzygrim) donation option which will usually be used to cover domain costs, self-hosting bills and related. In addition, I have removed the [Google font](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/blog/commit/45d82ba5bea55a65fc351095f2be6cb6cce3b974) and have opted for full local fonts. I have also [removed](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/blog/commit/c977a6bfb521935f731f80a6b8a09db33ee72341) the fading from left from the [post list](https://www.fuzzygrim.com/posts/) as it was starting to get a bit annoying.
