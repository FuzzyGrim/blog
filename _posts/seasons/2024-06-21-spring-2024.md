## Games I have played

These months I've played some cooperative games, in chronological order:

- Bokura
- Satisfactory
- A Way Out

Bokura is a small indie game that I found on Steam, it's a short game with an interesting concept. The game was fun but I had issues with connection multiple times. I have been enjoying Satisfactory a lot, it's a Factorio-like game but in 3D, as the name suggests, it's quite satisfactory. Lastly, I played A Way Out with a friend and it was a nice experience, nothing too special but it was fun.
