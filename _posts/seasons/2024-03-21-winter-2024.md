## Games I have played

Continuing with my gaming spree, I've played a few more games this season, in chronological order:

-   Cyberpunk 2077
-   Resident Evil Village
-   Portal 2

I was disappointed with Cyberpunk 2077, after hearing that the game was fixed, I decided to give it a try. It wasn't like I hated it but I can't say it was a great experience either. The story felt bland and none of the characters were interesting except some of the DLC characters. The gameplay and the world felt good at times, but I had many breaking bugs and crashes that made the experience worse. 

On the other hand, I had a blast with Resident Evil Village, it was just a fun game to play and was the perfect length for me. And lastly, I played Portal 2 with a friend in co-op mode and it was quite good too, the difficulty was just right and the coordination needed was fun.
