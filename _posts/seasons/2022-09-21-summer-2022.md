Summer is over, and that means the temperature should start dropping, or so I hope. It has been the hottest summer I can remember in a long time, with temperatures rising above 40C for a whole month.

## Mechanical keyboard

Since reding this [post](https://not-matthias.github.io/posts/mechanical-keyboard/), I've been digging down the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole and I have to say that I am really enjoying and learning a lot. From the type of switches to custom keyboard layers and yeah, also about group buys. 

Well, since then I have bought the [Akko Alice](https://en.akkogear.com/product/acr-pro-alice-plus-mechanical-keyboard/) and have been enjoying it, but I am thinking of modding it. My initial thoughts are to add some tape mod and poly-fill in the near future.

## Arisu layout

Although the keyboard has the name "Alice" in it, it seems that it has an "Arisu" layout that differs from "Alice" by the inclusion of the arrow keys. As you can see in this [image](https://en.akkogear.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Spray-Painted-Black-CP1.jpg), the keyboard I bought has a different layout than usual, it makes it more ergonomic to type, and I found it quite easy to get used to. Although I've known how to touch type for a while now, I wasn't doing it correctly and have been learning to use the home row key technique. I started with [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) which helped me learn which fingers should be used for which keys and now I am developing my muscle memory with [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).

## College

With the end of summer also comes the start of my sophomore year, I am quite excited for this semester as it looks like I will have much more programming classes than last year which was all about math and physics. I will have subjects about data structures, algorithms, and also Linux! And it seems that I will be learning C, assembly and bash in this semester.
