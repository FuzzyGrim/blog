## Clean the cache in your /home directory
As we use our system, the cache will fill up and take up a lot of space. The folder dedicated to the cache is `~/.cache`, if you want to check the size of the folder, you can do it with this command:
```
du -sh ~/.cache/
```

If you see that the cache folder is big and you want to clear it, you can use this commands:
```
rm -rf ~/.cache/*
```

## Remove unwanted packages

This command shows all the packages that you have installed explicitly with their respective memory size, this can be used to check if there is any software that you no longer use and want to remove:   

```
pacman -Qei | awk '/^Name/{name=$3} /^Installed Size/{print $4$5, name}' | sort -h
```

The same command as the previous but it only shows packages installed from the AUR:

```
pacman -Qim | awk '/^Name/{name=$3} /^Installed Size/{print $4$5, name}' | sort -h
```

Uninstall all unneeded packages and their unused dependencies:
```
sudo pacman -Rsn $(pacman -Qdtq)
```

Also, the next time you remove a package, instead of using the usual `pacman -R package-name`, use `pacman -Rs package-name`. This will remove the target package and all packages that were installed as dependencies for that package that aren't required by any other packages. If you also want to delete the configuration files corresponding to the package, use `pacman -Rns package-name`.


## Clean pacman cache

You can first check the total number of cached packages with: 
```
sudo ls /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ | wc -l
``` 

And the total disk space used with:
```
du -sh /var/cache/pacman/pkg/
```

To clean the cache created by pacman, we will be using a program called `paccache` which is in `pacman-contrib`. To clean all packages except the 3 most recent versions, run the following command: 

```
sudo paccache -r
```

Pacache also allows you to choose how many recent versions you want to keep, for example, if you just want to keep the latest version, you can use:
```
sudo paccache -rk1
```

You can limit the action of paccache to uninstalled packages, to remove all cached versions of uninstalled packages, use:
```
sudo paccache -ruk0
```

It is also possible to automate paccache. With the following command, `paccache` deletes the cache weekly:
```
sudo systemctl enable paccache.timer --now
```

If you want `paccache` to clean the cache monthly, you will need to create `/etc/systemd/system/paccache.timer` and add:

```
[Unit]
Description=Clean-up old pacman pkg

[Timer]
OnCalendar=monthly
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Another option is to create a pacman hook, this will run `paccache` after a determined pacman operation, for example if you want it to run whenever you upgrade, install or remove a package; just create `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/clean_package_cache.hook` and add:

```
[Trigger]
Operation = Upgrade
Operation = Install
Operation = Remove
Type = Package
Target = *
[Action]
Description = Cleaning pacman cache...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/paccache -rk 1 -ruk 0
```


## Clean system logs

You can check the disk space used by the journal files with:
```
journalctl --disk-usage
```

This can be removed using `rm` on `/var/log/journal/` or by `journalctl`. You can keep only the latest logs by size limit (e.g. Keep only 100Mb of the latest logs):

```
journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
```

Or by time limit:
```
journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```

After cleaning the log files, you can uncomment `SystemMaxUse` in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` to limit the disk usage used by these files by , e.g: `SystemMaxUse=500M`


## Clean broken symlinks
There may be some broken symlinks in your system which you may want to delete. If you want to get a list of all the broken symlinks in your system, use this commands:
```
find / -xtype l -print
```
Then check and remove the unwanted and unnecessary entries from this list.

## Extra tips and recommendations:

### Dependency tree
To view the dependency tree of a package, use `pactree` from `pacman-contrib`:

```
$ pactree broot
broot
├─gcc-libs
│ └─glibc provides glibc>=2.27
│   ├─linux-api-headers provides linux-api-headers>=4.10
│   ├─tzdata
│   └─filesystem
│     └─iana-etc
└─zlib
  └─glibc
```
To view the dependent tree of a package, pass the reverse flag `-r` to `pactree`:
```
$ pactree -r xmonad
xmonad
└─xmonad-contrib
```

If you just want a simple list instead of a tree view, you can use `pacman -Qi package-name | grep "Depends On"` and `pacman -Qi package-name | grep "Required By"`

To get a list of the packages you have installed sorted by the date and time, you can use this script:
```
#!/bin/sh
# Loop through packages explicitly installed
for i in $(pacman -Qe)
do
  # Search your installed packages in pacman.log
  grep "\[ALPM\] installed $i" /var/log/pacman.log
done | \
  sort -u | \
  # Clean the output
  sed -e 's/\[ALPM\] installed //' -e 's/(.*$//'
```

### Software
If you want to check which folders are taking a lot of space, I recommend using [ncdu](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/ncdu/), you can install it with `sudo pacman -S ncdu`.

If you want a software that makes a backup when you upgrade your system, you can try [timeshift-autosnap](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/timeshift-autosnap/). This package is only available in the AUR, therefore for installing it, use `paru -S timeshift-autosnap` or your preferred AUR helper. You can also use timeshift for automatic backups depending on your desired interval.
