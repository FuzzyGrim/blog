[This repository](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/docker-compose) will serve as documentation for my self-hosted services, it is not intended as a guide for other users, but feel free to use it as a template if you find it useful. You can find some actual guides on this [blog](https://www.fuzzygrim.com/tags/#self-hosting), I have posts on how to host a media server, how to safely expose services to the internet and more.
