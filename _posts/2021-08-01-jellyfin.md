## What is Jellyfin, Sonnarr, Radarr and Jackett?

### Jellyfin 
Jellyfin is a client/server media player system. When you install a media server program on your computer, it becomes your host server. You can connect to it from your phone and stream the media that's stored on your computer's hard drive. Think of it like YouTube or Spotify, but your computer is the server and the content that is available is based on the media files on the computer. Another more known media server is Plex, but Jellyfin is a completely free and open-source alternative. The Jellyfin server is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows and I'll be using Macos for this guide, however the process will be really similar.

### Sonnarr/Raddarr/Jackett
You know how you have to manually download episodes of the shows you like? Well, these three applications will help with that. They will automatically download new episodes as they become available, also, it can replace lower quality videos with higher quality ones once they become available. Sonarr if for series and Radarr for movies. Jackett is an app that will help Sonarr and Radarr search for different shows and movies from different trackers.

## Jellyfin configuration
Install the latest Jellyfin server from [here](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/). For Macos, remember to move the app to the Application folder. On Arch Linux, you can isntall Jellyfin from the AUR as [jellyfin-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jellyfin-bin/).

After installing Jellyfin, you should first find out your server IP. On MacOs you can find it by going to System Preferences > Network > Advanced > TCP / IP > IPv4 Address. It's usually 192.168.1.* in my case it's 192.168.1.38.

Now run Jellyfin and navigate on your browser using http://<your-server-ip>:8096. You should see an output as below:
